# opencl
provide 4 sub-packages: 
- pure, midle and  high, theese packages are named according level of abstaction, which provide
- constants rewrite all constants to GO by script
# still in develop !!!
this is still in develop, I translate CGO to [purego](https://github.com/ebitengine/purego), inspirate by low level wrapper for OpenCL in C (https://github.com/krrishnarraj/libopencl-stub), every helps, corrects are welcome ...
# pure
this is fork and simplify of https://github.com/Zyko0/go-opencl, but for most people too much, because it is wrapper 1:1 so no space to regular GO's error handling, also my fork of opencl(from https://github.com/MasterOfBinary/go-opencl) is too much high level of abstraction, so choose is on your preferencies ..., it is almost finish
# midle
this is true fork of https://github.com/Zyko0/go-opencl ..., in progres
# high
fork of https://github.com/MasterOfBinary/go-opencl ...., in progress
# examples
....
